# Implementation Steps:

    ## Preprocessing:
        Clean and preprocess the text (lowercasing, removing stopwords, etc.).

    ## Levenshtein Distance Calculation:
        Calculate the Levenshtein distance between the user answer and the correct answer.

    ## TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity:
        Convert the text to TF-IDF vectors and compute cosine similarity.

    ## Decision Making:
        Combine the results from both methods to make a final decision.
